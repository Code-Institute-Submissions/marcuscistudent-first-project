# Rolling Pebbles Band Website


This is my first project for Code Institute, I was tasked with developing a website for a band.
I didnt want to use templates or any pre existing code to create the website so
I coded it all in HTML and CSS from scratch.

I wanted to display the bad members, to show some of the vunes that they play at, to show what
is sold at their store and also to have a contact page.
The webpage is designed to give the user a taste of what sort of image and music the band produce.

There is a sample song, a video and clickable links, the site is also
responsice and works well on mobile as well as other devices.



UX

I wanted to view a band website. have a preview of what they do, gain a little bit
of info about the band and for the user to understand enough about them for them to enquire
about tour dates, tickets and merchandise. The video clip of the band shows them performing
and the audio clip is to one of their records.


Features

the website uses javascript to enable a responsive dropdown menu for different screen sizes
there are icons from font awesome to make the site more navigatable

the contact page makes it easy to contact the owner of the site and the events page
makes it possible to see where the band have played and where they are playing next.

If the Band existed then I would get real footage and music to put on the website as well as
images of the actual merchandise for sale.

The step after that would be to create a shopping cart using stripe and creating a user login,
register, and logout function with automated emails when purchases are made.


Testing

The website has now been rigorously tested, the images have been minified and
GIMP was used to scale the images.

The website has been tested on different screen sizes, browsers and devices
including phones and everything loads correctly.

all links function correctly and all elements that have been implemented render the
way that they should.


Deployment

The webpage is deployed using github pages. I have only changed the links and 
image tags in the deployed version so that they lead to the correct source.
I added first-project/ before most of my tags because that is the format that
github pages requires.
