# Rolling Pebbles Band Website

The wbesite is a tribute to the Rolling Pebbles band(Rolling Stones tribute band).

The website displays band members, the venues toured, the band merchandise and
a contact page.

The webpage is designed to give the user a taste of what sort of image and music the band produces.

There is a sample song, a video and clickable links, the site is also
responsive and works well on mobile as well as other devices.

## The site can be viewed [here](https://marcuscistudent.github.io/first-project/index).

## UX

The goal in the design was to was to create website which is easy to navigate
and gives the user and idea of what the band represents.

The black and grey colour scheme was chosen to represent a rock feel to the site.

The website should create an interest in the band and allow the users to enquire
about merchandise and about the latest gigs that can be booked.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)
4. Font Awesome (4.7.0)
5. Jquery


## Features

The website uses Jquery to enable a responsive dropdown menu for different screen sizes.

### Features left to implement

In the future, more music tracks will be added and more images.

The step after that would be to create a shopping cart and a user login,
register, and logout function with automated emails when purchases are made.


## Testing

The website has been tested, the images have been minified and
GIMP was used to scale the images to improve the loading time.

The website has been tested on different screen sizes(Mobile, Laptop, Ipad), 
browsers(chrome, IE and FireFox) and devices to make sure that
everything loads correctly.

All of links function correctly and all elements that have been implemented render the
way that they should.

The contact form link opens up an email account on all browsers and devices tested.

The merchandise page uses a ```href="#scroll-to-here"``` href so that users can 
easily navigate to ```id="scroll-to-here"``` so they can purchase merchandise or tickets.

## Deployment

The webpage is hosted using GitHub pages. 
The links and image tags in the deployed version have been changed so 
that they lead to the correct source for GitHub pages to render.
```first-project/``` was added before most of my tags because that is the format that
GitHub pages requires.

To run the repository locally, you can download the files and upload them
to the editor of your choice or enter this into your terminal
```git clone https://github.com/marcuscistudent/first-project.git```.
